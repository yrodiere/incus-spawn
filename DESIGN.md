# incus-spawn Design Document

A CLI tool for managing isolated Incus-based development environments. System containers that behave like bare-metal Linux machines, designed for safely running untrusted AI agents and external reproducers in OSS projects.

## Why not Docker?

Docker and Podman are **application containers**: they isolate a single process with a minimal filesystem, no init system, and restricted networking. This is ideal for deploying microservices but poor for development environments where you need:

- A real init system (systemd) for services like podman socket, sshd, or dbus
- Full networking: `ping`, `traceroute`, `tcpdump`, DNS resolution that works like a real machine
- Nested containers: running Podman/Docker inside the environment (Testcontainers, CI pipelines)
- Debugging tools: `strace`, `perf`, `gdb` — all require capabilities or sysctls that Docker strips
- GUI applications via Wayland passthrough with GPU acceleration, and audio via PipeWire

Incus **system containers** run a full Linux userspace with their own init, networking stack, and process tree. They share the host kernel (like Docker) but present as a complete machine rather than a process jail. For stronger isolation, Incus also supports KVM virtual machines with a separate kernel, at the cost of a modest performance overhead.

The tradeoff: system containers are heavier than application containers (~200MB base vs ~5MB Alpine). This is acceptable for development environments that persist for hours or days, and copy-on-write storage means clones are cheap regardless of base image size.

## Goals

- **Secure by default**: isolated environments that prevent untrusted code from accessing host credentials or resources
- **Bare-metal experience**: containers with full init, real networking, working developer tools — developers shouldn't notice they're inside a container
- **Extensible without Java**: image definitions and tool installations defined in YAML; Java only needed for tools requiring programmatic logic
- **Ephemeral and cheap**: copy-on-write clones mean spinning up a new environment costs seconds and minimal disk space
- **Familiar**: CLI patterns inspired by git workflows (branch-name-style naming, auto-detection from cwd)

## Tech Stack

- **Quarkus CLI** with picocli extension
- **Tamboui** (https://tamboui.dev/) for interactive TUI (list view, modal dialogs, inline actions)
- **GraalVM native image** for optional zero-dependency distribution
- **JBang** for easy installation (`jbang app install isx`)

## Architecture

### Container Model

- **System containers** by default (lightweight, full init system), with `--vm` flag for KVM VMs (stronger isolation, separate kernel)
- Containers don't drop capabilities (`lxc.cap.drop =`) and relax kernel paranoia (`ptrace_scope`, `perf_event_paranoid`, `ping_group_range`) to match bare-metal behaviour
- No GUI by default; Wayland + GPU passthrough available at branch time
- Three network modes at branch time: full internet (default), proxy-only, or airgapped
- Container user: `agentuser` (UID 1000, passwordless sudo)

### Template Image Hierarchy

Images are defined in YAML and layered via copy-on-write. Built-in definitions live in `src/main/resources/images/*.yaml`; user-defined images in `~/.config/incus-spawn/images/` can extend or override them:

```
tpl-minimal   (Base OS only — no tools)
  └── tpl-dev   (Podman, GitHub CLI, Claude Code)
        └── tpl-java  (JDK packages + Maven tool)
```

Additional Java tools available: `pi` (Pi coding agent). Not included in built-in templates; users can add it to custom image definitions.

Each image definition specifies:
- `name` — container name (required)
- `description` — human-readable description for the TUI
- `image` — base OS image, only for root images (default: `images:fedora/44`)
- `parent` — parent image name (omit for root images)
- `packages` — dnf packages to install
- `tools` — tool names to run (resolved from YAML or Java)

Building an image automatically builds missing parents recursively. `isx build --all` rebuilds every defined image from scratch.

**Resolution order** (later overrides earlier): built-in YAML (classpath) → user-defined YAML (`~/.config/incus-spawn/images/`) → search paths (`searchPaths` in config.yaml) → project-local (`.incus-spawn/images/`). Definitions with the same name from a later source override earlier ones.

### Tool System

Tools define how software gets installed into template images. Two formats:

**YAML tools** (primary format) — declarative, no Java needed:

```yaml
name: maven-3
description: Apache Maven (latest 3.x)
run:
  - |
    MAVEN_VERSION=$(curl -s https://dlcdn.apache.org/maven/maven-3/ ...)
    ...
verify: mvn --version
```

Schema fields (all optional except `name`):
- `packages` — dnf install
- `downloads` — artifacts to download, cache on the host, and extract into the container (with optional SHA256 verification and symlink creation)
- `requires` — list of other tool names that must be installed first (resolved transitively)
- `run` — shell commands as root
- `run_as_user` — shell commands as agentuser
- `files` — files to write (path, content, optional owner)
- `env` — lines appended to agentuser's `.bashrc`
- `verify` — verification command (logged, non-fatal)

Execution order: packages → downloads → run → run_as_user → files → env → verify.

**Transitive dependency resolution** (`requires`): Tools can declare dependencies on other tools. During build, `resolveWithDeps()` performs a recursive depth-first traversal to build the full dependency graph. Circular dependencies are detected and reported. Auto-added dependencies are logged: "Auto-adding dependency: sshd (required by idea-backend)". Dependencies are installed before the tools that require them.

**Java tools** (fallback) — for tools needing programmatic logic beyond what YAML supports:
- Implement `ToolSetup` interface (`name()` + `install(Container, Map<String, String>)`)
- Discovered via CDI (`@Dependent`)
- Currently used by: `claude` (binary install + settings), `gh` (dnf install), `pi` (npm install + settings)

**Resolution order** (later overrides earlier): built-in YAML (`resources/tools/`) → user-defined YAML (`~/.config/incus-spawn/tools/`) → search paths → project-local (`.incus-spawn/tools/`). A YAML tool with the same name replaces any earlier definition. Java CDI implementations (`@Dependent` beans) are used as fallback when no YAML tool matches.

### Build Flow

**`buildFromScratch` (root image, no parent):**
1. Launch base OS image
2. Configure security (idmap, nesting, syscall interception, no capability dropping)
3. Relax kernel paranoia (sysctl: ping_group_range, dmesg, perf, ptrace)
4. Configure DNS (disable systemd-resolved, point at Incus bridge gateway)
5. Upgrade system packages
6. Create agentuser (UID 1000, passwordless sudo)
7. Install base packages (git, curl, which, procps-ng, findutils)
8. Install image-defined packages via dnf
9. Install image-defined tools (resolved from YAML/Java)
10. Clone declared repos (with reference optimization — see below)
11. Configure terminal title (`PROMPT_COMMAND` in `.bashrc` sets `isx:<hostname>`)
12. Pre-trust cloned repo directories in `.claude.json` (if Claude Code is installed)
13. Clean caches (dnf, /tmp)
14. Tag metadata (version, SHA, definition fingerprint, CA fingerprint, build source), stop

**`buildFromParent` (derived image):**
1. Copy parent image, start, wait for network
2. Install image-defined packages via dnf (deduplicated — see below)
3. Install image-defined tools (with transitive `requires` resolution)
4. Clean caches
5. Tag metadata, stop

**Package deduplication**: Before installing packages, the build walks the parent chain and collects all packages from ancestor images and their tools. These are subtracted from the current image's package list so derived images only install what's new. The build logs both the count being installed and the count already present in ancestors.

### Branching

Like `git branch`, branching creates an instant copy-on-write clone of any template image. Each branch has its own independent filesystem -- changes in one branch cannot affect the template image or any other branch. The CoW storage backend (btrfs/zfs/lvm) deduplicates unchanged data transparently at the block level, so branches are instant to create and only consume disk space for their own modifications.

The TUI branch modal supports:
- Custom name
- GUI and audio passthrough (Wayland + PipeWire + GPU)
- Network mode selection (full internet / proxy-only / airgapped) via three-state radio
- Inbox mount (read-only host directory for sharing files into the container)
- VM resource limits (CPU, memory, disk)

### Resource Limits (Adaptive)

Detected at branch time from host resources:

- **CPU**: `available_cores - 2` (host keeps 2 cores, minimum 1)
- **Memory**: 60% of total RAM
- **Disk**: 20GB root disk

Overridable via TUI branch modal (for VMs, all three fields are shown).

### Container Configuration

**Capabilities**: `lxc.cap.drop =` (don't drop any — the container is the security boundary).

**Sysctl relaxation** (`/etc/sysctl.d/99-dev-container.conf`):
- `net.ipv4.ping_group_range = 0 2147483647` — unprivileged ping
- `kernel.dmesg_restrict = 0` — read kernel logs
- `kernel.perf_event_paranoid = 1` — perf profiling
- `kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0` — strace/debuggers

**DNS**: systemd-resolved disabled, `/etc/resolv.conf` points at Incus bridge gateway (`incusbr0`), immutable via `chattr +i`.

**Terminal title**: The host terminal title is set to `isx:<containername>` during `isx shell` sessions (via OSC escape sequences) and restored on exit. Inside containers, `PROMPT_COMMAND` in `.bashrc` overrides Fedora's default title-setting to maintain the `isx:<hostname>` title. Claude Code's built-in terminal title override is also suppressed so the container name stays visible.

### Remote IDE Access

The built-in `idea-backend` tool installs the JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA remote development backend and registers the container for JetBrains Gateway discovery. It uses the `requires` field to automatically pull in the `sshd` tool, which configures an OpenSSH server with pubkey-only authentication. This enables IDE-based development inside containers: Gateway connects over SSH and runs the IntelliJ backend process inside the container, with the full project available.

### GUI and Audio Passthrough

Enables GUI applications and audio inside containers:
- GPU device passed through for hardware-accelerated rendering
- Host `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` bind-mounted, exposing the Wayland socket and PipeWire/PulseAudio socket
- Environment variables written to `/etc/profile.d/wayland.sh` (`WAYLAND_DISPLAY`, `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`, toolkit backends)

### Network Modes

Branches run in one of three network modes, selectable via CLI flags or the TUI branch modal:

**Full internet** (default): Container stays on the `incusbr0` bridge with NAT masquerading. Unrestricted outbound access to the internet. Traffic to intercepted domains (Anthropic, GitHub) is transparently authenticated by the host MITM proxy — credentials never enter the container in any form.

**Proxy only** (`--proxy-only`): Container stays on the bridge but iptables OUTPUT rules restrict all outbound traffic to the MITM proxy (port 443) and DNS. The container can only reach intercepted domains via the MITM proxy.

Container-side firewall rules:
```
iptables -A OUTPUT -o lo -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -m conntrack --ctstate ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <gateway> -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT     # MITM proxy
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <gateway> -p tcp --dport 18080 -j ACCEPT   # Health check
iptables -A OUTPUT -d <gateway> -p udp --dport 53 -j ACCEPT      # DNS
iptables -P OUTPUT DROP
```

**Airgapped** (`--airgap`): Network device detached or removed. Complete network isolation — no egress at all.

### Auth & Security: MITM TLS Proxy

**API keys and tokens never enter containers.** A host-side MITM TLS proxy (`isx proxy`) provides transparent authentication. Placeholder values satisfy tools' local auth checks (e.g. `GH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`), but the proxy replaces them with real credentials before requests reach upstream servers.

**How it works:**

1. The proxy configures bridge-level DNS overrides (via `raw.dnsmasq` on `incusbr0`) so all containers resolve intercepted domains to the gateway IP
2. Template images include a custom CA certificate (generated during `isx init`) so containers trust the proxy's TLS certificates
3. The proxy listens on port 18443 on the gateway IP. An iptables PREROUTING redirect rule (installed by `isx init` via `firewall-cmd --permanent --direct`) transparently redirects traffic arriving on `incusbr0` destined for port 443 to port 18443, avoiding conflicts with the Incus daemon on port 443. The proxy terminates TLS using per-domain certificates signed by the custom CA
4. Based on the target domain, the proxy injects authentication headers:
   - `api.anthropic.com` — `x-api-key: <anthropic-api-key>` (direct mode) or Vertex AI passthrough/translation with GCP Bearer token (Vertex mode, see below)
   - `github.com` (git HTTP) — `Authorization: Basic <base64(x-access-token:token)>`
   - Other GitHub domains (API, CDN) — `Authorization: Bearer <github-token>`
   - Container registry and Maven domains — relayed transparently with caching (no auth injection)
5. The proxy re-encrypts and forwards to the real upstream over TLS

**Vertex AI support:** When the host is configured for Vertex AI (`useVertex=true` in config), containers run Claude Code in **Vertex mode** with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1`, and `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1`. This causes the Vertex SDK inside the container to send already-formatted Vertex requests (`/v1/projects/.../models/...:streamRawPredict`) to `api.anthropic.com`, which resolves to the proxy via dnsmasq. The proxy then forwards to the real Vertex endpoint with GCP credentials. No GCP credentials enter the container.

Running containers in Vertex mode (rather than standard mode) is required because Claude Code's model list depends on the provider: standard mode ("firstParty") shows a hardcoded subset that may omit newer models, while Vertex mode shows the full model catalogue. Using Vertex mode in the container ensures the `/model` picker matches what's available on the host.

**Three-way routing for Anthropic traffic:**

The proxy routes requests to `api.anthropic.com` through one of three paths based on the URL:

1. **Vertex passthrough** (`/v1/projects/...`): Requests already in Vertex format (from the container's Vertex SDK). The proxy strips `@date` model version suffixes from the URL (the global endpoint rejects them), removes the `anthropic-beta` header, injects a GCP Bearer token, and forwards to the real Vertex endpoint. The body is passed through unmodified — the Vertex SDK already formats it correctly.

2. **Standard-to-Vertex translation** (`/v1/messages`): Requests in standard Anthropic API format. The proxy buffers the body and translates to Vertex `rawPredict` format (see translation details below). This path is used if a container happens to send standard-format requests (e.g. from curl).

3. **Direct forwarding** (all other paths): Non-messages endpoints (settings, bootstrap, feature flags, MCP registry) are forwarded to the real `api.anthropic.com` with credential injection. These endpoints don't exist on the Vertex API.

**Standard-to-Vertex translation details** (path 2):

- URL: `/v1/messages` → `/v1/projects/{projectId}/locations/{region}/publishers/anthropic/models/{model}:rawPredict` (or `:streamRawPredict` when `stream=true`)
- Auth: replaces `x-api-key` with `Authorization: Bearer <gcp-token>` (obtained via `gcloud auth print-access-token`, cached ~50 minutes)
- Body: extracts `model` field and moves it into the URL path, stripping date suffixes (e.g. `claude-sonnet-4-6-20251001` → `claude-sonnet-4-6`)
- Body: adds `"anthropic_version": "vertex-2023-10-16"` (required by Vertex rawPredict)
- Body: strips all top-level fields not in the Vertex allowlist (beta features like `context_management` cause "Extra inputs" rejections)
- Body: recursively strips `scope` from nested `cache_control` objects (beta feature unsupported by Vertex)
- Header: removes `anthropic-beta` (Vertex rejects beta feature flags; features are enabled via `anthropic_version`)
- Host: rewrites to the Vertex endpoint hostname for the configured region

The body translation uses an allowlist approach: only known-good fields (`messages`, `system`, `max_tokens`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `stop_sequences`, `stream`, `metadata`, `tools`, `tool_choice`, `thinking`, `output_config`, `anthropic_version`) are kept. Everything else is dropped. This is more robust than blocklisting individual beta fields, since new Claude Code beta features are automatically stripped without proxy changes.

**Vertex AI protocol details** (learned from testing):

- **Hostname resolution by region**: The standard pattern is `{region}-aiplatform.googleapis.com` (e.g. `us-east5-aiplatform.googleapis.com`), but some meta-regions use special hostnames: `global` → `aiplatform.googleapis.com`, `us` → `aiplatform.us.rep.googleapis.com`, `eu` → `aiplatform.eu.rep.googleapis.com`
- **Model naming**: The Vertex SDK uses `@` for model version suffixes in URL paths (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001`), while the standard API uses `-` (e.g. `claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`). The global Vertex endpoint only accepts short model aliases without any version suffix — both `@20251001` and `-20251001` forms are rejected. The proxy strips both forms.
- **Beta features**: The `anthropic-beta` header is rejected by Vertex rawPredict with "Unexpected value(s) for anthropic-beta header". This includes common beta flags like `claude-code-20250219`, `interleaved-thinking-2025-05-14`, `web-search-2025-03-05`, and `prompt-caching-scope-2026-01-05`. Features like extended thinking work without any beta flags on Vertex — they're enabled via `anthropic_version`. The Vertex SDK moves `anthropic-beta` header values into the body as an `anthropic_beta` array, but even that is rejected ("invalid beta flag"). The proxy strips the header entirely without adding it to the body.
- **Auth skipping**: `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1` causes the Vertex SDK to skip GCP authentication and return stub credentials that produce empty auth headers. The proxy then replaces these with real GCP tokens.
- **Base URL override**: `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL` redirects all Vertex SDK requests to a custom endpoint. Setting it to `https://api.anthropic.com/v1` causes the container's Vertex SDK to send requests to `api.anthropic.com`, which resolves to the proxy via dnsmasq.
- **Response format**: Vertex `rawPredict` returns standard Anthropic response format — no response translation is needed.

**Pi coding agent support:** Pi is a provider-agnostic coding agent that always communicates via the standard Anthropic API (`/v1/messages`). Unlike Claude Code, Pi does not have a Vertex mode — it always sends standard API requests with an `x-api-key` header. The proxy handles both direct key injection and standard-to-Vertex translation transparently. No Vertex-specific environment variables are needed inside the container; `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-placeholder` is the only auth configuration.

**Intercepted domains:** `api.anthropic.com`, `github.com`, `api.github.com`, `raw.githubusercontent.com`, `objects.githubusercontent.com`, `codeload.github.com`, `uploads.github.com`, `registry-1.docker.io`, `auth.docker.io`, `ghcr.io`, `quay.io`, `repo.maven.apache.org`, `repo1.maven.org`, `plugins.gradle.org`

**HTTPS only:** The proxy intercepts HTTPS traffic, so Git operations must use HTTPS URLs (not SSH). `gh` defaults to HTTPS automatically; for `git clone`, use `https://github.com/...` instead of `git@github.com:...`.

All other domains (package mirrors, PyPI, etc.) route normally via Incus bridge NAT and are unaffected by the proxy.

**Credential validation**: Building a template image that includes `claude`, `pi`, or `gh` tools requires the corresponding credentials to be configured on the host. Both the CLI and TUI check this before starting a build and abort with a clear error if credentials are missing.

**Version drift detection**: The proxy health check (run before builds, branches, and shell access) compares the running proxy's version against the CLI version. If they differ: when no containers are running, the proxy is automatically restarted; when containers are running, a warning is shown with instructions to restart manually. This prevents subtle failures from CA certificate or protocol mismatches.

**CA certificate mismatch**: At branch time, `BranchCommand` compares the template's `ca-fingerprint` metadata against the current CA certificate. If they differ (e.g. after `isx init` regenerated the CA), a warning is shown suggesting to rebuild the template. This prevents TLS failures in branches where the container's trusted CA doesn't match the proxy's signing CA.

**Vertex AI token refresh**: Vertex AI requests that receive a 401 response are retried once with a fresh GCP access token (the cached token is invalidated). This handles token expiry during long-running sessions without user intervention.

**Buffered I/O**: The proxy uses 64KB `BufferedInputStream`/`BufferedOutputStream` on both client and upstream connections for throughput. SSE and chunked streaming responses are flushed after each line/chunk to avoid buffering delays.

**Configuration**: `~/.config/incus-spawn/config.yaml` (owner-only permissions, `chmod 600`). CA key and certificate at `~/.config/incus-spawn/ca.key` and `~/.config/incus-spawn/ca.crt`. Vertex AI users must have `gcloud` installed on the host and `gcloud auth application-default login` completed.

### Host Resources

Template images can declare host files and directories to share with containers via the `host-resources` YAML key. Three modes control how the resource is made available:

**Readonly** (default): a read-only Incus disk device bind mount. The container can read the host file/directory but cannot modify it. Simple and safe for config files like `~/.gitconfig`.

**Overlay**: the host directory is attached as a read-only lower layer, with an ephemeral writable upper layer inside the container, combined via Linux overlayfs. The container sees a normal read-write directory, but writes go to the container-local upper layer — the host is fully protected. This is the right mode for caches (Maven, OCI) where tools expect to write but you don't need writes to persist back to the host.

**Copy**: the file or directory is copied into the container at build time and becomes part of the template. Supports local paths and URLs. No runtime dependency on the host.

#### Overlay internals

For a host-resource with `mode: overlay` targeting `/home/agentuser/.m2/repository`:

1. **Build time**: the host directory is attached as a read-only Incus disk device at `/var/lib/incus-spawn/overlays/home/agentuser/.m2/repository/lower`. The container creates `upper` and `work` siblings, then runs `mount -t overlay` to present the merged view at the target path. A systemd service (`incus-spawn-overlays.service`) is installed and enabled to re-apply the overlay mount on boot.

2. **After build**: the overlay is unmounted and the disk device is removed from the stopped template. The upper and work directories remain as container-local files. The full host-resource configuration is stored as JSON in `user.incus-spawn.host-resources` metadata.

3. **At branch time**: `BranchCommand` reads the stored metadata and re-attaches the disk device to the stopped instance before starting it. On boot, the systemd service re-mounts the overlay. The upper layer — now containing build artifacts — was copied via CoW when the instance was branched, so each instance has its own independent writable layer.

4. **On reboot**: the systemd service fires on every boot and re-mounts overlays. This works even if the container is started directly via `incus start` rather than through `isx`.

The overlay directory structure mirrors the container path directly under `/var/lib/incus-spawn/overlays/`, so the layout is self-documenting:

```
/var/lib/incus-spawn/overlays/home/agentuser/.m2/repository/
  ├── lower/    ← read-only disk device mount (host directory)
  ├── upper/    ← container-local writable layer (follows CoW branching)
  └── work/     ← overlayfs internal bookkeeping
```

Incus disk device names are derived from the container path for readability (e.g. `hr-home-agentuser--m2-repository`). They are removed from stopped templates to avoid host-path dependencies and re-attached at branch time.

#### Missing sources

If a host path doesn't exist at build or branch time, the entry is skipped with a warning. The build/branch proceeds without it.

#### Inheritance

Host resources compose additively across the parent chain, with override-by-container-path. If a parent declares `~/.gitconfig` as `readonly` and a child declares `~/.gitconfig` as `copy`, the child's mode wins. This follows the same last-write-wins pattern as package deduplication.

### Metadata Tracking

Containers tagged via Incus `user.*` config keys:

```
user.incus-spawn.type=base
user.incus-spawn.profile=tpl-java
user.incus-spawn.parent=tpl-dev
user.incus-spawn.created=2026-04-07
user.incus-spawn.build-version=0.1.11        # isx version that built the template
user.incus-spawn.build-sha=c434ef9           # git commit SHA of isx at build time
user.incus-spawn.definition-sha=a1b2c3d4     # fingerprint of image def + tool defs
user.incus-spawn.ca-fingerprint=AB:CD:EF:... # CA certificate fingerprint
user.incus-spawn.build-source={...}          # (JSON, full image + tool defs for out-of-scope visibility)
user.incus-spawn.network-mode=PROXY_ONLY     # (proxy-only branches only)
user.incus-spawn.proxy-gateway=10.166.11.1   # (proxy-only branches only)
user.incus-spawn.host-resources=[...]        # (JSON, when host-resources declared)
```

**Staleness detection**: The TUI uses `build-version` and `definition-sha` to display staleness indicators next to template names:
- `!` — template was built with a different isx version than the running CLI
- `△` — the image definition or its tool definitions have changed since the last build (fingerprint mismatch)
- `↑` — a parent template was rebuilt more recently than this template

**Build source storage**: `build-source` stores the full image definition hierarchy and tool definitions as JSON. This allows templates built from definitions that are no longer in scope (e.g. project-local definitions from a different working directory) to still be displayed and rebuilt in the TUI.

### Storage and COW

Copy-on-write storage is essential for efficient branching. `isx init` automatically creates a btrfs storage pool (`cow`) if no CoW-capable pool exists. All instance creation (`launch` and `copy`) auto-detects the best CoW pool and uses it via `--storage`, regardless of what the default Incus profile points to.

Supported CoW drivers: **btrfs**, **zfs**, **lvm**. If btrfs pool creation fails during init (e.g. unsupported filesystem), the user is warned and can continue with the `dir` driver, but clones will be full copies.

### Repo Cloning and Reference Optimization

Repos declared in an image definition are cloned into the container during build as `agentuser`. Clones use `--single-branch` to fetch only the target branch (or the default branch when none is specified), avoiding the download of hundreds of release/PR branches and thousands of tags that are present on large upstream repos but rarely needed in a dev container. After cloning, `git remote set-branches origin '*'` immediately widens the fetch refspec — this is a pure metadata write with no network traffic — so the clone is indistinguishable from a regular one. Other branches populate lazily on first `git fetch` or `git checkout`.

**Reference clone optimization**: When `host-paths` or `repo-paths` is configured in `~/.config/incus-spawn/config.yaml`, the build checks whether a matching host-side checkout exists before cloning. When multiple `host-paths` are configured and a repo subdirectory exists in more than one path, the build fails with an error instructing the user to add an explicit `repo-paths` entry to disambiguate. Matching uses URL normalization (strips scheme, `user@`, SSH colon separator, trailing `.git`, `www.`, then lowercases) and checks **all** git remotes, not just `origin` — this handles the common case where the user's fork is `origin` and the canonical upstream is `upstream`. If a match is found, the host directory is temporarily mounted into the container as a read-only Incus disk device (`readonly=true shift=true`) at a fixed path under `/var/lib/incus-spawn/repo-ref/` and passed to `git clone --single-branch --reference <path> --dissociate`. Git satisfies most objects from the local copy (typically 70–90% for large repos with a reasonably current checkout), reducing network traffic from hundreds of megabytes to a small delta of commits added since the last `git fetch`. The `--dissociate` flag makes the resulting clone fully self-contained so the device can be immediately removed. If the reference mount or clone fails for any reason the build falls back transparently to a plain clone.

**TUI visibility**: The F3 template detail view shows the host repo link status for each declared repo — the resolved host path when matched, or "No matching host checkout found" when not. This lets users verify their `host-paths`/`repo-paths` configuration without running a build.

### Git Remote Helper

Containers cloned via `isx branch` are isolated development environments, but developers need a way to get their changes back to the host. Rather than inventing a custom sync mechanism, incus-spawn integrates with git's native remote helper protocol so standard `git fetch`/`git push`/`git pull` work between host repos and container repos.

**Architecture: bash shim + Java command**

The git remote helper is split into two processes:

1. **`git-remote-isx`** (bash script): installed alongside `isx` in `$PATH`. Git discovers it automatically when a remote URL uses the `isx://` scheme. The script handles the text-based git remote helper protocol (advertising the `connect` capability), then `exec`s `isx git-remote-helper` to handle the actual transport.

2. **`isx git-remote-helper`** (Java/picocli command): validates the instance is running, validates the requested service against an allowlist, and launches `incus exec <instance> -- su -l agentuser -c "<service> '<path>'"` with inherited stdin/stdout so the git pack protocol flows directly between the host git process and the container git process.

The bash `exec` replaces the shell process with the Java process before any data flows through stdin. This is critical: Java's `BufferedInputStream` would consume bytes from the stdin pipe that are meant for the git pack protocol, corrupting the stream. By having bash handle only the text protocol exchange (a few short lines) and then `exec`-replacing itself, the Java process inherits the raw file descriptors with no buffered-ahead data.

Stderr is captured in a virtual thread so the command can detect "not a git repository" errors and print hints listing known repos from the image definition chain.

**URL scheme**

`isx://<instance-name>/<path-to-repo>` — for example, `isx://fix-auth/home/agentuser/quarkus` or `isx://fix-auth/~/quarkus` (tilde expands to `/home/agentuser`).

**Auto-remote management**

When the user configures `host-paths` (and optionally `repo-paths`) in `config.yaml`, incus-spawn automatically adds and removes git remotes in host repositories:

- **On `isx branch`**: for each repo declared in the image definition chain, resolve the corresponding host repo via `repo-paths` (exact match) or `host-paths` (base directories + repo name). When multiple `host-paths` are configured and a repo subdirectory exists in more than one path, the operation fails with an error instructing the user to add an explicit `repo-paths` entry. Verify that any of the host repo's remotes (not just `origin`) match the container repo's URL (protocol-lenient comparison). If a match is found, add a remote named after the instance.
- **On `isx destroy`**: scan candidate host repos for any remote with a URL matching `isx://<instance-name>/` and remove it.

The removal is stateless — rather than tracking which remotes were added, we scan for `isx://` URLs matching the instance name. This avoids a class of bugs where state gets out of sync (e.g., the user manually removes a remote, or the add failed silently).

**Protocol-lenient URL matching**

Host repos may use SSH URLs (`git@github.com:org/repo.git`) while container repos use HTTPS (`https://github.com/org/repo.git`). The URL matcher normalizes both formats by stripping the scheme, `user@` prefix, SSH `:` separator, trailing `.git`, `www.` prefix, and lowercasing. The result is a canonical form like `github.com/org/repo` that matches regardless of protocol.

## Testing

**Unit tests** (`mvn test`, no Incus needed):
- `ToolDefTest` — YAML tool parsing, fingerprinting, composite fingerprints with transitive dependencies
- `ToolDefLoaderTest` — resolution order (builtins, user overrides, unknown tools)
- `YamlToolSetupTest` — execution order with mocked Container
- `ImageDefTest` — image definition loading, parent chain, descriptions, fingerprinting
- `BuildCommandTest` — `.claude.json` trust configuration, skill deduplication across inheritance chains, shell quoting, GitHub URL parsing
- `GitRemoteUtilsTest` — URL normalization (SSH/HTTPS/case), protocol-lenient matching, reference device naming (hash-based, truncation, collision resistance), host repo matching across multiple remotes

**Integration tests** (`mvn verify -DskipITs=false`, requires Incus):
- `TemplateBuildIT` — builds actual images, verifies metadata and agentuser

## Technical Tradeoffs

### System containers vs application containers
System containers run a full init system and present as a complete machine. This means higher base image size (~200MB vs ~5MB Alpine) and longer first-build time (system upgrade, user creation, tool installation). However, clones are instant and near-zero cost with CoW storage, which is the common operation — you build once, branch many times.

### No capability dropping (`lxc.cap.drop =`)
Standard Incus containers drop many Linux capabilities for defense-in-depth. We don't, because the container *is* the security boundary and developers expect `ping`, `strace`, `perf`, raw sockets, and `dmesg` to work. The risk is that a container escape exploit has more host capabilities to abuse. For untrusted code where this matters, use `--vm` for KVM isolation with a separate kernel.

### YAML tools vs a full plugin system (Packer, Ansible, etc.)
We evaluated Packer (null builder + shell provisioner) and Ansible but rejected both. Packer's null builder is just indirection over what Java already does, and Ansible adds a Python dependency and playbook complexity for what amounts to "install some packages and run some scripts." YAML tool definitions give 90% of the flexibility with zero dependencies. Java `ToolSetup` implementations remain available as an escape hatch for tools that need programmatic logic (reading host config, conditional branching).

### Hardcoded built-in tool list vs classpath scanning
Built-in YAML tools are loaded from a hardcoded list of filenames rather than scanning the classpath. This is a deliberate choice: Quarkus native image compilation makes classpath directory listing unreliable, and the list only changes when a developer adds a built-in tool (at which point they also update the loader). User-defined tools in `.incus-spawn/tools/` are discovered via filesystem scanning.

### DNS: static resolv.conf + bridge dnsmasq
systemd-resolved (127.0.0.53) doesn't work reliably inside Incus containers because it expects to manage the network configuration. We disable it, point `/etc/resolv.conf` directly at the Incus bridge gateway (which runs dnsmasq), and make the file immutable with `chattr +i`. This is less flexible than systemd-resolved (no per-link DNS, no DNSSEC validation) but works reliably across container restarts and network changes. Domain interception for the MITM proxy is configured at the bridge level via `raw.dnsmasq` (dnsmasq `address=` directives), not via per-container `/etc/hosts`. This avoids a class of bugs where Incus overwrites `/etc/hosts` on container start.

### Credential isolation via MITM TLS proxy
A TLS-terminating MITM proxy intercepts HTTPS connections to specific domains (Anthropic API, GitHub), injects authentication headers server-side, and forwards to the real upstream. Containers resolve these domains to the gateway IP via bridge-level dnsmasq overrides (configured when `isx proxy` starts) and trust the proxy's certificates via a custom CA installed in the template image. This approach was chosen over simpler alternatives (reverse proxy with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, credential helpers, shell wrappers) because those approaches still expose credentials to code running inside the container — either as environment variables, in process memory via `curl` calls, or through accessible endpoints. The MITM proxy provides complete isolation: there is no API, endpoint, environment variable, or file that container code can access to obtain credentials.

### Vertex AI: container in Vertex mode vs standard mode
We initially ran containers in standard (non-Vertex) mode with proxy-side API translation — the container sent `/v1/messages` and the proxy rewrote to Vertex `rawPredict`. This had a critical flaw: Claude Code's model list is provider-dependent. In standard "firstParty" mode the model picker is a hardcoded subset that omits newer models (e.g. Opus 4.6 was missing). In Vertex mode the full catalogue is shown.

The solution: containers now run in Vertex mode with `CLAUDE_CODE_USE_VERTEX=1`, `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1` (skips GCP auth — the SDK uses stub credentials that produce empty auth headers), and `ANTHROPIC_VERTEX_BASE_URL=https://api.anthropic.com/v1` (redirects the Vertex SDK to the proxy). The Vertex SDK formats requests in Vertex URL format (`/v1/projects/.../models/...:streamRawPredict`), sends them to the proxy, and the proxy injects real GCP credentials before forwarding to the actual Vertex endpoint. The proxy also retains the standard-to-Vertex translation path for `/v1/messages` requests — this is the primary path for tools like Pi that use the standard Anthropic API format, and also serves manual `curl` calls inside the container.

**Fragility and mitigation:** The standard-to-Vertex translation path uses an allowlist (`VERTEX_ALLOWED_FIELDS` in `MitmProxy.java`) that may drift as Anthropic adds new standard fields. However, the primary traffic flow (Vertex passthrough) doesn't use the allowlist — the Vertex SDK already formats the body correctly. The allowlist only affects the fallback translation path. The `anthropic_version: "vertex-2023-10-16"` value is hardcoded in the translation path — this matches the Anthropic Vertex SDK and has been stable since Vertex support launched. The Vertex passthrough path doesn't set this value; the SDK does it itself.

### Git remote helper: bash + Java split
The git remote helper is split into a bash shim and a Java command rather than implementing the full protocol in Java. The reason is stdin buffering: Java's `BufferedInputStream` (used by `System.in` and `ProcessBuilder`) reads ahead into an internal buffer. In the git remote helper protocol, the initial text exchange ("capabilities", "connect git-upload-pack") is followed by a binary pack protocol stream on the same stdin pipe. If Java reads even one byte too many during the text phase, the binary stream is corrupted. The bash shim handles only the text protocol (a few short lines via `read`), then `exec`-replaces itself with the Java process. The Java process inherits raw file descriptors with no buffered-ahead data and can safely pipe stdin/stdout through `incus exec` to the container's git process.

The alternative — implementing the full protocol in Java with careful single-byte reads — is fragile and would need to be re-validated with every JDK update that touches `System.in` buffering behaviour.

### Auto-remote: stateless cleanup vs state tracking
When an instance is destroyed, its git remotes need to be removed from host repos. Two approaches: (1) track which remotes were added in metadata and remove exactly those, or (2) scan host repos for `isx://` URLs matching the instance name. We chose stateless scanning because it's simpler and eliminates a class of state-sync bugs (user manually removes a remote, add failed silently, metadata gets corrupted). The cost is scanning a few git repos on every destroy, which takes milliseconds.

### Single-branch clone with lazy refspec restoration
Template builds clone repos with `--single-branch` to avoid fetching objects for all remote branches and tags — on a large project like Quarkus this is the difference between ~3 MiB and ~100 MiB of network traffic even with a current host reference. The fetch refspec is immediately widened with `git remote set-branches origin '*'`, which costs nothing (no network, no object transfer) and makes the clone behave like a regular one. Users never need to know they received a single-branch clone; `git fetch`, `git branch -r`, and `git checkout other-branch` all work as expected — other branches just populate on first access.

The alternative — a full clone — would download objects for hundreds of branches and thousands of tags that most container workflows never touch. Post-hoc pruning is not straightforward because git doesn't garbage-collect fetched objects unless explicitly told to. The single-branch + refspec-restore approach gets the performance benefit without any user-visible limitation.

### Auto-remote: opt-in via configuration
Auto-remote management requires explicit `host-paths` or `repo-paths` configuration. We don't attempt to auto-discover host repos because there's no reliable heuristic — the same repo name could exist in multiple directories, and scanning the filesystem would be slow and surprising. The user knows where their repos live.

### Fedora-specific
The base image and package management are Fedora-specific (`dnf`, `images:fedora/44`). This is intentional — supporting multiple distros adds complexity for a tool primarily targeting developer workstations where Fedora is a common choice. The YAML tool system is distro-agnostic in principle (tools can use any shell commands), but the built-in base image setup assumes Fedora.

## Security Considerations

### Container vs VM Trade-off
- **Containers** (default): share host kernel. A kernel exploit could escape. Suitable for semi-trusted code (AI agents with scoped permissions, community bug reproducers).
- **VMs** (`--vm` flag): hardware-level isolation via KVM. Recommended for actively malicious code. Separate kernel eliminates kernel exploit as an escape vector. ~10% performance overhead.

### Credential Isolation

Real API keys and tokens never enter containers, regardless of network mode. Containers hold only placeholder values that satisfy tools' local auth checks; the proxy replaces them with real credentials before requests reach upstream servers.

| Credential | Container has | How it works |
|-----------|--------------|--------------|
| Claude API key (direct mode) | Placeholder `sk-ant-placeholder` | Proxy replaces `x-api-key` header with real key |
| GCP credentials (Vertex mode) | **Nothing** | Container runs Claude Code in Vertex mode with `CLAUDE_CODE_SKIP_VERTEX_AUTH=1`. Proxy injects GCP Bearer token from `gcloud` on the host. No GCP credentials, service accounts, or access tokens enter the container |
| Pi Anthropic key | Placeholder `sk-ant-placeholder` in `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Same as Claude direct mode. Pi always uses standard API format; the proxy handles key injection or Vertex translation transparently |
| GitHub token | Placeholder `gho_placeholder` in `GH_TOKEN` | Proxy replaces `Authorization` header with real token for GitHub domains (Basic auth for `github.com` git HTTP, Bearer for API) |

The MITM TLS proxy provides credential isolation:
1. Bridge-level dnsmasq overrides (configured by `isx proxy`) route intercepted domains to the gateway IP
2. A custom CA certificate (installed in template images) lets containers trust the proxy's TLS certs
3. The proxy terminates TLS, replaces placeholder auth with real credentials, and forwards to real upstream over TLS
4. Placeholder values cannot authenticate against any service — they only bypass local tool checks
5. In proxy-only mode, iptables OUTPUT rules additionally block all egress except the proxy port (443) and DNS

### Filesystem Isolation
- Inbox mount is strictly read-only
- Host resources default to read-only; overlay mode provides an ephemeral writable layer but the host directory is never modified
- Clone filesystems are independent CoW copies — changes in one clone don't affect others or the template image
